Sliding Heap module by Steven Haslam 1992.

32 bit compatibility by Christopher Bazley and much additional work
by Harriet Bazley.

This version has been packaged for the RISC OS Packaging project
(www.riscpkg.org) by Alan Buckley <alan_baa@hotmail.com>.

To package it I've included it in an Application directory !SlidingHp
that sets a variable SlidingHp$Dir.

There are two packages, the normal that only includes the module and
the BASIC library to use it and a "dev" package that includes the
documentation and examples.

If you have installed the "dev" package you will find the documentation
and examples by holding shift and double clicking on the !SlidingHp
application.
